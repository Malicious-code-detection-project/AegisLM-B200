# Artifact Storage Policy

이 문서는 `AegisLM` fine-tuning 산출물의 저장 위치, 공개 범위, 금지 항목을 정의합니다.

`docs/design/datasets/DATA_STRATEGY.md`가 데이터 저장/제외 정책의 정본이라면, 이 문서는 모델 개발 산출물인 adapter, checkpoint, model card, evaluation artifact의 저장 정책 정본입니다.

## 1. Goal

Phase E tiny SFT PoC 전까지 다음 기준을 고정합니다.

- GitHub에 저장할 수 있는 항목과 금지 항목을 구분한다.
- LoRA/QLoRA adapter 산출물은 Git 밖에서 관리한다.
- Hugging Face Hub 사용 시 기본 공개 범위는 private으로 둔다.
- model card, training config, evaluation summary를 adapter와 연결한다.
- raw dataset, checkpoint, adapter, token, private CTI가 Git에 섞이지 않게 한다.

## 2. Storage Targets

| Storage | Allowed | Not allowed |
| --- | --- | --- |
| GitHub repository | source code, prompts, configs, schema, tests, docs, small synthetic fixtures, experiment log template | raw dataset, malware sample, checkpoint, adapter artifact, merged model, HF token, secrets, private CTI, large logs |
| Hugging Face Hub private repo | LoRA/QLoRA adapter, tokenizer changes, model card, training config snapshot, evaluation summary | raw dataset, intermediate checkpoint, secrets, private CTI, unsafe samples |
| Local or approved external storage | raw downloaded datasets, intermediate checkpoints, large logs, temporary training outputs | secrets in plain text, untracked public release artifact without owner approval |

GitHub remains the source of truth for code, configuration, documentation, and small safe fixtures. Hugging Face Hub is the default candidate for shareable adapter artifacts once provenance and safety metadata are ready.

## 3. GitHub Policy

The repository may contain:

- training and inference scripts
- prompt templates
- dataset schema and validators
- small metadata-only or synthetic fixtures
- experiment log templates
- evaluation harness code
- evaluation report templates or curated tiny examples
- documentation that points to external artifact locations

The repository must not contain:

- actual malware samples
- executable payloads or packed binaries
- raw downloaded datasets
- model checkpoints
- LoRA/QLoRA adapter artifacts
- merged full model weights
- Hugging Face tokens or API keys
- private CTI or private customer data
- large generated logs or run directories

If an experiment needs to reference an external artifact, commit only the artifact identifier, storage location, version tag, and safety/provenance notes.

## 4. Hugging Face Hub Policy

Hugging Face Hub is the preferred target for adapter artifacts after local validation. The default visibility is private.

Allowed Hugging Face artifacts:

- LoRA/QLoRA adapter files
- tokenizer files only when the tokenizer was intentionally changed
- model card
- training config snapshot
- evaluation summary JSON or concise report artifact
- dependency/version summary needed to reproduce the adapter

Do not upload:

- raw training dataset dumps
- malware samples or executable payloads
- intermediate checkpoints from unstable runs
- secrets, tokens, private CTI, or private customer data
- artifacts whose dataset license or provenance is not understood

Initial repo naming examples:

```text
<org-or-user>/aegislm-gpt-oss-20b-lora-phase-e
<org-or-user>/aegislm-adapter-tiny-sft-poc
```

Initial tag examples:

```text
phase-e-tiny-sft-v0
dataset-fixture-v0
eval-baseline-compare-v0
```

## 5. Model Card Requirements

Every adapter repo must include a model card before it is shared beyond the owner account.

Minimum fields:

- base model: `openai/gpt-oss-20b`
- adapter method: LoRA or QLoRA
- training dataset provenance summary
- excluded data categories
- intended use: defensive analysis explanation, summarization, mapping, and structured reporting
- out-of-scope use: malware generation, exploit execution, evasion, credential theft, persistence guidance
- evaluation summary and command reference
- known limitations
- safety notes
- license and terms notes
- related Git commit, Linear issue, and experiment log reference

The model card must not imply that AegisLM is the final security decision maker. Deterministic analyzer signals, curated labels, and human review remain the decision basis.

## 6. Public Release Gate

No adapter or model artifact is public by default.

Before changing a Hugging Face repo from private to public, all of the following must be true:

- dataset license and provenance have been reviewed
- no raw malware, private CTI, secrets, or private customer data are included
- safety review confirms the adapter is not trained to provide actionable malware guidance
- evaluation results are recorded and linked
- model card is complete
- owner approval is recorded in Linear or PR discussion

Merged full model publication is outside v0 scope and requires a separate issue.

## 7. Experiment Log Linkage

Each training run that creates an adapter should record:

- Linear issue
- Git commit
- base model and adapter method
- dataset path and dataset version
- training command
- package versions
- GPU type and VRAM
- output artifact location
- Hugging Face repo and tag when uploaded
- evaluation summary path
- known failures or safety notes

The experiment log may live in Git only if it contains no secrets, private data, raw dataset rows, or large generated logs.
